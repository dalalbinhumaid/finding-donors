## Project: Finding Donors for CharityML

A Udacity project, which aims to employ different supervised learning algorithms to find a suitable model to predict individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census, the goal of the project is to compare different algorithms based on certain metrics in order to find the best algorithm in determining which individual makes more than \$50,000 annually.

### Data

The modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper *"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid",* by Ron Kohavi.
